# EngChat Landing Page
This repository contains the official landing page for **EngChat**, a modern, secure, and privacy-focused messaging platform.

### 🔒 Why EngChat?
EngChat was built with the belief that communication should be:
- **Private** by default
- **Encrypted** end-to-end
- **Accessible** across mobile and desktop
- **Owned** by users, not third-party platforms

### 🌐 This Repository

This is the **public-facing landing page**, designed to:
- Introduce EngChat to new users
- Provide basic information and contact details
- Redirect users to download the mobile app or sign up

### ⚠️ Note
This repo is **separate** from the main EngChat backend and encryption core, which are **private and not accessible**.

### 🚫 License
